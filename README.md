# AES-Encryption-
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that is used to secure sensitive information.
This code implements AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption algorithm using Java programming language.
## Usage
To use this code, run the main method in the AES class. This will initialize an instance of AES_ENCRYPTION class which provides the AES encryption and decryption functionality.
## Performance
The code also measures the time taken to encrypt and decrypt the data using the System.nanoTime() method. The elapsed time is printed to the console.
